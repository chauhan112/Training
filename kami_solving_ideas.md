# steps:
  1. neighbour extract - done
  2. solve

## Solving strategy
* hypothesis testing
  * make neighbour network to tree form:- extract knowledge from this
  * maximum number of neighbour:- eg: the more number of neighbour a object has the better chance it has to combine all together
  * if a color connects all object of same color it must be right step:- argument: we need more than one step to delete the information i.e remove the structure. 
     So it the color connects all the objects with same color it must be the minimum step. however the order inwhich it should be done is still not clear yet.
  * same color object common neighbour:- Eg: if a particular object connect all the objects of same color, then it take precedence.
