## Tasks History

1. deletable prime (return how many ways)
    1. Tested all test cases(solved)
    2. Use Fermat's Little Theorem (reduce time of 11s to around 1s.)
    3. Code redesign 
3. Equimax (almost solved)
    * test with size 20, 
    * calculate equal size(fix eq_sp)
    * return only one result
    * check speed of algorithms(what is the maximum size algorithm can run)
5. 8 Queen chess board (in progress)
6. (solved) Armstrong number 
7. (solved) Prime numbers 


## optimize
* 8 queen problem: make it faster
